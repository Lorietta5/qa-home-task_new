# Hotel Booking API — QA home task

A small Node/Express reservation API used as a **test object for a QA
assignment**. The API is intentionally shipped with defects. Your job is to
find and report them.

This README and the generated API documentation at `/apidoc` describe the
**expected** behaviour. Any difference between that specification and what the
running API actually does is a bug.

## Running it

Requirements: Node 22 (or Docker).

```
npm install
npm start
```

The API listens on http://localhost:3001 and `/` opens the API docs. The data
store is in memory and is seeded with 10 random reservations on every start;
restart the server to reset.

With Docker:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Endpoints at a glance

| Method | Path               | Auth | Success | Errors                      |
|--------|--------------------|------|---------|-----------------------------|
| GET    | /health            | no   | 200     |                             |
| POST   | /login             | no   | 200 `{token}` | 401 `{reason}`        |
| GET    | /reservations      | no   | 200 `[{reservationId}]` | 400 bad date filter |
| GET    | /reservations/:id  | no   | 200 reservation | 404, 406            |
| POST   | /reservations      | no   | 200 `{reservationId, reservation}` | 400, 406 |
| PUT    | /reservations/:id  | yes  | 200 reservation | 400, 403, 404, 406  |
| PATCH  | /reservations/:id  | yes  | 200 reservation | 403, 404, 406       |
| DELETE | /reservations/:id  | yes  | 204 empty | 403, 404                  |

Anything not listed returns 404.

## Specification

### Authentication

`POST /login` with JSON `{"username": "manager", "password": "Hotel2024!"}`
returns `200` and `{"token": "<15 hex chars>"}`. Both values must match
exactly (case-sensitive, no partial matches). Any other credentials return
`401` with `{"reason": "Bad credentials"}`.

Write endpoints (PUT, PATCH, DELETE) accept **either**:

* a cookie `token=<token>` issued by `/login`, or
* `Authorization: Basic <base64(manager:Hotel2024!)>`.

A missing or invalid credential returns `403`. The Basic header must carry the
correct username *and* password.

### Reservation resource

```json
{
  "firstName": "Anna",
  "lastName": "Novak",
  "totalPrice": 111.5,
  "depositPaid": true,
  "stay": { "checkIn": "2013-02-23", "checkOut": "2014-10-23" },
  "specialRequests": "Late check-in"
}
```

Validation rules (apply to POST and PUT):

* `firstName`, `lastName`: required, non-empty strings. Surrounding whitespace
  is trimmed before storing.
* `totalPrice`: required number, `>= 0`. Decimal values are allowed and
  preserved exactly.
* `depositPaid`: required boolean. The stored value is always echoed back
  exactly as sent (in every response, including the create response).
* `stay.checkIn` and `stay.checkOut`: required, `CCYY-MM-DD`.
  `checkOut` must not be before `checkIn`.
* `specialRequests`: optional string.
* Unknown fields, including `reservationId`, are ignored.

A validation failure returns `400`.

### Ids

`reservationId` is assigned by the server, is a positive integer, is unique
and is **never reused**, even after a delete. A client can never choose or
overwrite an id. An id in the URL that is not a positive integer (e.g.
`/reservations/1abc`, `/reservations/-1`) is treated as not found (`404`).

### Listing and filtering: `GET /reservations`

Returns the ids of **all** reservations (no implicit limit). Optional query
parameters narrow the result; multiple parameters are combined with AND:

| Param       | Matches reservations whose…                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `firstName` | first name equals the value (case-insensitive, literal)    |
| `lastName`  | last name equals the value (case-insensitive, literal)     |
| `checkIn`   | check-in date is **on or after** the given `CCYY-MM-DD`    |
| `checkOut`  | check-out date is **on or before** the given `CCYY-MM-DD`  |

A `checkIn`/`checkOut` value that is not a valid date returns `400`.

### Content negotiation

Request bodies may be sent as `application/json`, `text/xml`,
`application/xml` (XML wrapped in a `<reservation>` element) or
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

Responses honour the `Accept` header: `application/json` (default, also used
for `*/*` or no header), `application/xml`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
Standard `Accept` syntax must work (e.g. `application/json; charset=utf-8`,
`application/xml, text/plain`). The response `Content-Type` always matches the
format actually returned. An unsupported `Accept` value returns `406`.

### Update semantics

* `PUT /reservations/:id` replaces the reservation **in full**. Fields omitted
  from the payload (such as `specialRequests`) are removed from the stored
  reservation.
* `PATCH /reservations/:id` merges the supplied fields into the stored
  reservation. The merge is deep: `{"stay": {"checkIn": "2020-01-01"}}`
  changes only `checkIn` and keeps the existing `checkOut`.
* `DELETE /reservations/:id` removes the reservation and returns `204` with an
  empty body. A later `GET /reservations/:id` returns `404`.

Full request/response examples for every endpoint are in `/apidoc`
(`npm run build_docs` regenerates them from the comments in `routes/index.js`).

## Writing tests

`mocha`, `chai` and `supertest` are installed as dev dependencies. Put your
specs in `tests/` and run `npm test`.

## QA Test Deliverables

This QA assignment includes the following test artifacts:

- `tests/api.test.js` — automated API tests.
- `test-cases.md` — test scenarios, steps and expected results.
- `bug-reports.md` — documented defects with reproduction steps and impact.
- `test-results.md` — test execution summary and findings.

- Manual API testing was performed using Postman. The tested scenarios and results are documented in `test-cases.md` and `test-results.md`.

### Running the automated tests

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run the automated test suite:

```powershell
$env:SEED = "true"
npx mocha .\tests\api.test.js
```

Alternatively, run the configured test script:

```powershell
npm test
```

### Current test status

The recorded execution produced the following results:

- Total tests: 8
- Passed: 5
- Failed: 3
- Defects identified: 3

The failing tests document discrepancies between the actual API responses and the expected behavior defined in this README. They are retained as regression checks and should not be changed simply to make the test suite pass.
